# Ralf Wiggum Scrum 🏎️💨

> **"Iteration beats perfection, but guided iteration beats everything."**

While the classic Ralph loop is a "waterfall" approach where you feed the AI a backlog and wait for completion, **Ralf Wiggum Scrum** introduces an **Eternal Development Engine**. It brings the stability of Agile review cycles to the speed of autonomous development, designed specifically for solo founders and small teams.

## 🧠 The Philosophy

### Classic Ralf (Waterfall)
You give the AI a PRD and a checklist. It runs in a finite loop until the checklist is done.
*   **The Drift:** If the AI makes a mistake in iteration 2, it spends iterations 3 through 10 building on a broken foundation.
*   **The Result:** You get a "finished" project that requires a total rewrite because you couldn't course-correct early.

### Ralf Wiggum Scrum (Eternal Loops)
The engine runs in **limitless loops**. It pauses only at sprint milestones for human validation.
*   **The Stability:** Catch "hallucination debt" immediately. Approve a sprint, and the engine launches the next one **instantly**.
*   **The Pivot:** Not happy? Provide feedback via `review_iteration.md`, and the engine automatically refactors future sprints to match your new direction.
*   **The Role:** You stop being a "prompter" and start being a **Product Owner**.

## 🛠️ The Toolbox

*   **Discovery Engine (`create_prd.md`)**: An interactive setup that interviews you to define your tech stack and atomic backlog.
*   **Eternal Engine (`ralph.js`)**: The autonomous core that executes sprints in a continuous flow.
*   **Interactive Review**: Logic for the `review-iteration` command to approve, fix, or pivot the engine's direction.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1.  **Initialize Discovery:**
    Launch the interactive setup to build your PRD and sprint plan:
    ```bash
    /create_prd
    ```
    
2.  **Engage the Loop:**
    Start the eternal engine. It will work autonomously until the first milestone:
    ```bash
    ./ralph.js
    ```

3.  **Review & Launch:**
    When the agent pauses, review the work.
    *   **Approve:** The next sprint starts immediately.
    *   **Pivot:** Provide feedback to automatically adjust the roadmap.

## 📈 Why Scrum for Solo Developers?

*   **Total Control:** Rely heavily on AI without losing the "steering wheel."
*   **No Hallucination Debt:** Catch improvements when they are cheap to fix, not at the finish line.
*   **Seamless Flow:** Designed for high-velocity builders who want a continuous stream of progress.
*   **Small Team Optimized:** Minimal overhead, maximum autonomous output.
